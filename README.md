6. Cheat Sheet: A cheat sheet or crib sheet is a concise set of notes used for quick reference. Cheat sheets were historically used by students without an instructor or teacher's knowledge to cheat on a test or exam.

7. Unit Test: In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.

9: IDE - An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. I used Jupyter Notebook due to its Pretty Display of Variables.

11: Functional Programming: Some of the functional programming I used and the link is given below:
